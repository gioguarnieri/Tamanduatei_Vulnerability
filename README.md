# Tamanduatei Vulnerability

This code calculates the point-wise vulnerability to the Tamanduatei basin. To execute this task we only need the <i>edgelist.dat</i> and <i>vulnerability.py</i>. The calculation will result in two results, one of them being the time it took in the <i>screen.out</i> file and the vulnerability to each node in <i>result.dat</i>. I will give a brief explanation on each file next.

## vulnerability.py

Here we calculate the vulnerability using python, the main module used is **igraph**. The point-wise vulnerability is calculated by calculating the entire network efficiency, defined as

or, more simply, the inverse of the distance between two nodes. After calculating all those inverse distances we are left with a matrix. Then, we make a mean with the lines, turning into a column and a mean with the column resulting in a number.

Mathematically put it would be
